# Final-Proyect-
This is my final project for the data science course in R on the Edx platform. In this project, I created a movie recommendation system for users using the MovieLens dataset and the Recosystem library.

Please, I encourage you to read the PDF file, where I explain in detail everything I did and how I got the results.
In the script file, you can see the lines of code used to solve the problem.
And in the RMD file, you'll see how the PDF file was created.
